A website of my very own-

This project is meant to eventuallybe a foundation for a portfolio website. Really it's a way to play around with React and BootStrap. As I did not
do much front end stuff on my previous project. Also a way to get more practice with JavaScripts's async behaviors.

I'm going to be starting offjust practicing with the MERN Stack as my framework. It is subject to change. 

Thank You to Traversy Media (https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb) for the MERN tutorial which is my starting point.
